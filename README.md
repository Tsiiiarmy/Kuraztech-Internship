# 🌱 KurazTech Internship

Welcome!
This repository showcases the work I've been doing as an intern at Kuraz Technologies — where I'm sharpening my skills and getting real-world experience in software development.

💼 What’s inside?
This repo includes a collection of tasks, practice projects, and learning materials I've worked on during the internship, with a strong focus on:

⚛️ React.js – building interactive UI components and practicing with props, state, and hooks

🎨 Frontend development – using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS to create responsive designs

🌐 Web development best practices – file structuring, reusable components, and performance tips

🔄 Git & GitHub workflows – daily commits, version control, and collaboration techniques

📚 Real-world problem solving – applying what I learn through hands-on mini projects and tasks

✨ About the Internship
This internship has been an amazing opportunity for me to grow as a Front-end developer. I’m learning not just to build apps, but also how to write clean code, debug efficiently, and think like a developer in a real work environment.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore the folders and see what I’ve been working on 🚀
